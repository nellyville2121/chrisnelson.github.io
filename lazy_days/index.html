      <p>Is your job taking too much time away from your rest and relazation? Does your algebra
       homework keep you up at night? I used to be in the same boat until i quit work and school and
     and devoted myself to doing absolutely nothing. Many people thing that laziness is a vice,
     but i am here to tell you that it is an art.</p>
